### Modeling effects of bilogical covariates (age, sex, BMI, anatomical location, etc.) on cell-type specific gene expression, and GWAS analysis linking lung disease-related genomic variants to lung cell types.
Each notebook contains a brief explanation of what is done inside at the top of the notebook. Here we list all notebooks, and show which notebooks produce figures from the paper:<br>
1\_variance\_contribution\_of\_tech\_and\_bio\_covariates.ipynb: Figure 4a, Extended Data Figure 7<br>
2\_covariate\_effect\_gene\_level\_modeling\_preparation.ipynb<br>
Covariate effect modeling, performed in R (see R folder in repository).<br>
The remaining notebooks will follow soon.
