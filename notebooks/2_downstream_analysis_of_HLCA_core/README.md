### Downstream analysis of the HLCA core.
Each notebook contains a brief explanation of what is done inside at the top of the notebook. Here we list the figures and tables from the paper that are generated in these notebooks. (Note that the figure numbers *inside* the notebooks might be outdated.)<br>

Main figures:<br>
4a: 1_variance_contribution_of_tech_and_bio_covariates<br>
4b-d: 4_GSEA_results_and_anatomical_location_effect_on_ct_proportions<br>
5d: 6_GWAS_to_celltype_results_visualization (GWAS celltype to linkage analysis scripts can be found in the [bash scripts folder](../../scripts/bash/LDSC_GWAS_to_celltype/).)<br>
5e: preparation in notebook 8-10, further scripts and visualization in R and bash scripts (see bottom notebook 10)<br>

Extended Data figures:<br>
ED 5: 4_GSEA_results_and_anatomical_location_effect_on_ct_proportions<br>
