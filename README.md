# HLCA reproducibility
This repository contains the code that was used for the Human Lung Cell Atlas project. 

## File organization:
You can find the main code used in the HLCA project in the [notebooks](./notebooks) of this repository. We subdivided the notebooks into three main categories:
- 1: building and annotating the atlas core  
- 2: modeling of covariates and GWAS analysis  
- 3: atlas extension
The notebooks folder is organized based on these three categories, with every sub-folder containing the used code. Notebooks are numbered to clarify the order in which to run the notebooks.

The data and results folders as used in the code are not included in this repository, as the size of the files is too large, but will be uploaded to figshare soon.

Currently, the first 17 notebooks have been added to this repository, plus several R scripts used in the analysis. The remaining notebooks will be uploaded very soon.
